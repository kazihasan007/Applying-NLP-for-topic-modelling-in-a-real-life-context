# Background Context
This project applies NLP techniques for topic modeling in a real-world context, focusing on uncovering actionable insights from large volumes of text data. By automating topic identification, businesses can quickly extract trends and themes, improving decision-making, productivity, and strategic planning. The project bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications to enhance data analysis in a business setting.

# Objective
The goal is to analyze customer reviews from Google and Trustpilot for a gym chain to identify key themes, drivers, and areas for improvement in customer experience. This involves preprocessing text data, generating word clouds, applying BERTopic for topic modeling, performing emotion analysis, and validating results with Gensim’s LDA model. The project also leverages the Falcon-7b-instruct model to uncover topics and suggest improvements.

# What It Demonstrates

It highlights the ability to extract trends, validate insights, and communicate findings effectively. By leveraging state-of-the-art NLP tools, it demonstrates the capacity to deliver actionable recommendations to improve business operations and customer satisfaction.
